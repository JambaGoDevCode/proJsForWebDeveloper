#### WHAT’S IN THIS CHAPTER?

- Review of JavaScript history
- What JavaScript is
- How JavaScript and ECMAScript are related
- The different versions of JavaScript



### Javascript implementations 

- The Core (ECMAScript)
- The Document Object Model (DOM)
- The Browser Object Model (BOM) 



### EcmaScript

- Syntax
- Types
- Statements
- Keywords
- Reserved words
- Operators
- Global objects

What does ecmascript conformance mean?
- Support all “types, values, objects, properties, functions, and program syntax and semantics”
as they are described in ECMA-262.
- Support the Unicode character standard.
- Add “additional types, values, objects, properties, and functions” that are not specified in ECMA-262. ECMA-262 describes these additions as primarily new objects or new properties of objects not given in the specification
- Support “program and regular expression syntax” that is not defined in ECMA-262
(meaning that the built-in regular-expression support is allowed to be altered and extended).


### The Document objet model 

The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for XML that
was extended for use in HTML.
