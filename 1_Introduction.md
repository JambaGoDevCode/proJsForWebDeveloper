# Introduction

- Web browsers and their JavaScript engines all implement this specification as
they see fit. Chrome has Blink/V8, Firefox has Gecko/SpiderMonkey, and Safari has WebKit/Java
ScriptCore. 

The first edition of this book was published in 2005.

- At the time this fifth edition was written
in 2023, major browsers have coalesced around the ECMA-262
specification, over 70 percent of
Internet traffic uses a Chromium-based
browser, mobile browser traffic exceeds desktop traffic, and
modern web development largely comprises manipulating frameworks like React and Angular.

- Annual ECMAScript editions ensure the lan
guage
addresses developer needs and stays abreast of industry trends.

- the Stack
Overflow 2022 Developer Survey listed JavaScript as the most popular programming language for
the 10th consecutive year.

- In this book, JavaScript is covered from its very beginning in the earliest Netscape browsers to the
present-day
incarnations flush with support for a dizzying spectrum of browser technologies.

- In short, you learn how to apply JavaScript solutions
to problems faced by web developers everywhere.

- Experienced developers familiar with object-oriented
programming who are looking to learn
